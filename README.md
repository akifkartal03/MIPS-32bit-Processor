## Implementation of a different version of 32-bit MIPS processor with 14 instruction by using Verilog language in Altera Quartus II.
### Supported Instructions

- lw (load word)
- sw (store word)
- j (jump)
- jal (jump and link)
- jr (jump register)
- beq (branch if equal)
- bne (branch if not equal)
- addn (add "different")
- subn (subtract "different")
- xorn (xor "different")
- andn (and "different")
- orn (or "different")
- ori (or immediate)
- lui (load upper immediate)

#### The R-type instructions will execute different than the conventional MIPS. This is why they have ‘n’ at the end (representing new).
